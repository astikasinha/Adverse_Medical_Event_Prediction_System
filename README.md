A machine learningâ€“powered NLP tool that classifies user-described symptoms into categories like **mild**, **adverse**, or **critical**. It highlights the most influential keywords contributing to the prediction and generates a **comprehensive PDF report** for medical or analytical use.

---

##  Features

- Symptom severity classification (`mild`, `adverse`, `critical`)
- Keyword importance analysis (via TF-IDF)
- Probability distribution of predictions
- Auto-generated PDF report using `fpdf`
- CLI and/or API ready (optional extension)

---

##  Objective

To provide healthcare professionals and researchers with an **automated pipeline** for:

- Classifying unstructured symptom descriptions.
- Highlighting contributing symptom keywords.
- Generating structured reports for offline or clinical use.

---

##  Machine Learning Pipeline

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Missing values handled.
   - Text preprocessing (lowercasing, punctuation removal, etc.).

2. **Text Vectorization**  
   - Using `TfidfVectorizer` from `scikit-learn`.

3. **Model Training**  
   - Trained a `Logistic Regression` classifier on labeled symptom data.

4. **Keyword Importance**  
   - Extracted top weighted TF-IDF terms contributing to classification.

5. **PDF Reporting**  
   - Used `fpdf` to generate clean, printable reports.

## Dataset Overview

| Column | Description                     |
|--------|---------------------------------|
| text   | Symptom description (e.g. "paralysis in limbs") |
| label  | Severity category (`mild`, `adverse`, `critical`) |

---

## Sample Input & Output

**Input:**
Paralysis in limbs
**Output:**
```yaml
Predicted Label: adverse

Top Contributing Keywords:
- limbs: 0.3342
- paralysis: 0.3342
- in: 0.1019

Prediction Probabilities:
- mild: 0.12
- adverse: 0.76
- critical: 0.12

PDF Report: Generated as symptom_report.pdf
